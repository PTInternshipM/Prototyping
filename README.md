# Prototyping

This repo is used for an internship for storing code of prototypes of mobile frameworks.
Each individual prototype was written within 1 hour, therefore the code quality may not be the best.

Please do not try to contribute to this repo, as it is for educational purposes only and probably will not be updated _ever_, after all the prototypes have been added.
